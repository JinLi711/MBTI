==========
Background
==========

MBTI stands for the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, a personality system to divide personality types into 16 groups.

Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)
Intuition    (N) – Sensing      (S)
Thinking     (T) – Feeling      (F)
Judging      (J) – Perceiving   (P)

For example, a person labeled as INTJ has attributes of Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, and Judging.

Meaning:
(I) vs (E): Does the person prefer their inner world or outer world?
(N) vs (S): Does the person prefer interpreting and adding meaning or focusing on basic infomation?
(T) vs (F): Does the person look at logic and consistency or look at the people and circumstances?
(J) vs (P): Does the person prefer deciding things or staying open to new infomation or options?
