Visualization
=============

Observe snippets of text from each type.


=============
Preprocessing
=============

Split into train, validation, and test set.
Dimension reduction.

======
Models
======

Constrain the weights.
Tune the model with different hyperparameters:
    *learning rate (large with decay)
    layer size
    layer number
    kernel
    stride
    activation functions

Multioutput (one output for each pair) or single output (16 types)
RNN
1D CNN
Random Forests
XG Boosts
Ensemble all of them.
k-fold validation

=======
Testing
=======

See if I can get text from somewhere else and apply this.
View result on tensorboard (I couldn't get the TensorBoard callback to create histograms or embeddings)
Visualize model with keras.
